Open Universal Remote (OUR)
Well, before you get too excited about this, this is not a serious project. It is something I want to build for my self. 

Oh, what's that?
There are numerous crowdfunded Smartphone controlled Universal Remotes, that have not delivered! I want to build a under $10 blue-tooth based Remote. No wifi/internet. No certifications. No fancy case.

So what's the Plan?
ESP32, will use Bluetooth and BLE to receive signals from phone and route them to the phone using built in Remote Periperhals and few passives.

I also want to figure out why some of the huge campaigns have failed to deliver while building this. Everything that I build for the project or use will be open-source. So that project can remain alive for a longer time and hopefully somebody will also make it.

ESP32 has built-in Remote Peripheral (actual built in hardware to encode and decode the IR signals.) and Bluetooth Radio (both classic and BLE). These can be used to build a single chip OUR.
